# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (v2.1)

As contributors and maintainers of "My-own-photoshop-webapp-in-7-days", we pledge to make participation in this project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This Code of Conduct applies both inside project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at https://github.com/ruthviksharma-d or by opening an issue labelled `code-of-conduct` (if it is safe to do so). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project maintainers are:

- @ruthviksharma-d

When contacting the maintainers, please provide as much information as possible, including links, screenshots, and relevant context. Maintainers will treat reports with discretion and confidentiality where possible.

Consequences for unacceptable behavior may include temporary or permanent removal from the project, banning from project spaces, or public communication of the decision in cases where it is necessary to protect the community.

If the maintainer(s) are the subject of a complaint or you do not feel safe raising the issue in the repository, you may contact GitHub Support. For immediate danger, contact local authorities.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces — the repository, issues, pull requests, mailing lists, chat rooms, and any other official or unofficial spaces where project contributors interact. It also applies to public behavior when an individual is representing the project.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html.
